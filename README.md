An experimental library for building propagator networks, as described in [this paper](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/44215/MIT-CSAIL-TR-2009-002.pdf) by Alexey Radul and Gerald Sussman.
Also special shoutout to Ed Kmett.  I was inspired to make this after looking through [his own propagator library](https://github.com/ekmett/propagators).

This library mostly caters to building propagation networks for relational programming and constraint satisfaction problems.
Check out the [examples](/examples) to get an idea of how to use it.
